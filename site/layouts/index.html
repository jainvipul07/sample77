                   <article>
                   <p>AWS Marketplace is a buyer and seller online shop launched by Amazon in 2012. It enables a user to buy and sell software that runs on Amazon Web Services.<br>

A company uses the AWS Marketplace to market and sell its AWS-approved software products; Amazon oversees sellers and products in the AWS Marketplace to verify their reliability, ethics and security levels. Amazon also controls all billing and payment options through AWS user information. Software sold in the AWS Marketplace aims to add value to current AWS public cloud services; it is available in a variety of software categories.<br>

Once software has been purchased from the AWS Marketplace, the end user downloads and deploys it. AWS maintains all records of billing, payment collection and reporting through user accounts; buyers and sellers access the products through the AWS Management Console. Software purchased on the AWS Marketplace can be used across a variety of categories.
